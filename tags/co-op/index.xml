      <description>This game is great fun as it provides an opportunity for cooperation as oppose to competition with it&amp;rsquo;s co-op modes. I&amp;rsquo;m basing it off of a 2 player playthrough, but it now supports up to 4 players.
The overall premise of the game is to pilot a spaceship to save little trapped critters from mechanical monsters. Everything is whismical in nature and the game rewards helping others.
There&amp;rsquo;s some level of strategy in having to man shields, guns and the motor of the ship with just two people.</description>
