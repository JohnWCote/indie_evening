This was another rogue-like dungeon crawler that we found to be incredibly frustrating. Reviews praised this game in its single-player form, so perhaps there lies the difference, but we turned to Cheat Engine to extract some semblance of enjoyability after only the first boss. Note: we played on normal difficulty.
At first, Wizard of Legend pulls you in with interesting graphics and powerful spells, lots of upgrades to collect, a bustling hub full of merchants, and the promise of challenging gameplay, but it goes downhill after the tutorial.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/children-of-morta/">

We wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about how the action-RPG Children of Morta played in single-player-mode, and from other reviews it appears to be quite good, but from our experience, this was a game best described as grindy, grindy, grindy, with the wholesome, family-centred storyline serving to hold our attention just enough that we played it through with the help of Cheat Engine.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/mortal-shell/">

This gives the player the opportunity to play various classes in a playthrough and switch between the classes as deemed necessary.
The fighting mechanic is tight and rather souls like, but has enough new mechanics, such as how blocking is handled to make the fights progress in a different way. This makes the fights more than the standard: roll, dodge, hit and repeat.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/cuphead/">

To be frank, it is extremely challenging, especially in two-player mode where the bosses have extra health. We found it to be frustrating because there&rsquo;s no strategy to these fights‚Äîno deviation in the enemy&rsquo;s attack from attempt to attempt, no items to pick up to modify gameplay, no ability to regain lost lives.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/hue/">

The main mechanic grants the player the ability to change the background colour of a level from grey to one of eight unlockable colours, allowing Hue to jump through and have other interactions with objects of the same or different colour (colourblind mode available, which we played with on, for the sake of clarity).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/8bitdo-sn30pro-plus/">

It&rsquo;s the 8bitdo SN30Pro plus. It&rsquo;s a rechargeable bluetooth wireless controller that has very classic stylings (mine is red, but there&rsquo;s also a purple button variation). There&rsquo;s software to customize the button layouts, analog joystick triggering and trigger throw distance. The bottom triggers are analog and the d-pad is very tight.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/hardware/">hardware</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/one-shot/">

We received OneShot by Future Cat as part of the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality on itch.io, and though it is a single-player adventure puzzle game, we still had a blast solving it&rsquo;s puzzles and figuring out its secrets together. You play by guiding a little cat-person named Niko through a solemn, atmospheric world in need of a new sun, and along the way, you learn about Niko, a mysterious entity who wants to hinder your progress, a mysterious entity who wants to help your progress, and a whole slew of characters trying to survive in a bleak world.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/hollow-knight/">

It&rsquo;s a platformer in nature, but has some strategic elements due to the fact that there&rsquo;s emblems you can acquire that work like power-ups and they can be used in different combinations.
The world has quite a bit of atmosphere and the music deepens this experience greatly. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a dark game, but rather a little melancholy in parts.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/lovers-in-a-dangerous-spacetime/">

I&rsquo;m basing it off of a 2 player playthrough, but it now supports up to 4 players.
The overall premise of the game is to pilot a spaceship to save little trapped critters from mechanical monsters. Everything is whismical in nature and the game rewards helping others.
There&rsquo;s some level of strategy in having to man shields, guns and the motor of the ship with just two people.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/co-op/">co-op</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/togetherness/">togetherness</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/boi-rebirth/">

That being said it&rsquo;s an interesting dark adventure in treasure hunting and slaying grotesque monsters. In it&rsquo;s default form it&rsquo;s not extremely fun as a co-op game. However, if you install the antibirth mod it becomes quite an awesome 2 player experience. I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to be something that we would play co-op together, but the randomness of the power ups and the fact that it&rsquo;s still rather cartoony in nature had us picking up the controller and doing runs even before we found the 2 player mod: http://www.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/gaming/">gaming</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/indie/">indie</a></p></li></ul><div class="pagination">
